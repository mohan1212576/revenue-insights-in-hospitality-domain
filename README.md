## 🚩 Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a renowned five-star hotel chain operating across India, was experiencing declining market share and revenue amidst rising competitive pressures and internal decision-making inefficiencies. Without an in-house analytics team, they sought external support to derive actionable insights from their historical booking data.

As the data analyst on this project, I was responsible for transforming raw booking data into strategic insights through advanced metrics and an interactive dashboard that directly supports the revenue management team.
